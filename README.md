# Sentimental Analysis using NLP

End-to-end Sentiment Analysis project using NLP techniques and Random Forest on Amazon Alexa reviews.

This project applies Natural Language Processing and machine learning to classify Amazon Alexa reviews as positive or negative. Using tools like NLTK, CountVectorizer, and a Random Forest classifier, the project walks through a complete end-to-end sentiment analysis pipeline from text preprocessing to visualization and evaluation.
